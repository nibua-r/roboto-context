## Description

roboto-context is a [ConTeXt](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page) typescript for Roboto, Roboto
Condensed and Roboto Slab families.

## Features

Enable Roboto usage in ConTeXt.

## Roboto fonts

You can download Roboto and Roboto Condensed from the
[Android Developer Website](http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html). The Roboto
Slab fonts are a little bit more difficult to find but, since you're here, I have no doubt you'll
find them.
